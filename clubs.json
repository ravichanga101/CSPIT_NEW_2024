A total of 18 students from Semester 3 participated in the same. When all the students had reported at the CSE AI/ML LAB, we started the workshop at around 2:20 P.M. At the very beginning of the session, students seemed interested to dig deeper into the topic. The expert started the lecture by explaining very basic and real-life examples such as ChatGPT and other AI advancement tools that we use on a daily basis. Thereafter, he continued to explain the same topic on a technical level and how the industry of AI grew and shifted towards it. Furthermore, he gave an idea about how Generative AI is a branch of AI. Compared with the classical machine learning approach, he explained how a machine learning task is different from text/image/music generation. After this, the foundation models were explained which are used to build a Generative AI model. The revolution and LLM, which stands for Large Language Model, were explained thoroughly. To understand the input parameters given to any Generative AI model, prompts are an essential requirement. This topic was explained in depth to help students understand how to generate a prompt to get a perfect output as we want. Different types of prompts were explained nicely (shot prompts). In addition, he explained about the evolution of cloud ML APIs which are providing multipurpose foundation models for AI models, and more concisely explained about Google Cloud and how it can help in the field of Gen AI. Vertex AI was also explained in depth. At the end of this session, the expert provided links and QR codes for GitHub repositories of Generative AI and some other related links to understand Gen AI better and finally concluded with a fruitful discussion and doubt-solving session.",

Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. Verilog,standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems. It is most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register- transfer level of abstraction. This workshop will be a platform for the students to learn LTSpice Tool from the scratch. LTSpice is a SPICE-based analog electronic circuit simulator computer software, produced by semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices. It is the most widely distributed and used SPICE software in the industry. This would provide an extensive opportunity to the participants for getting knowledge of LTSpice Tool. Under this perspective, aim of this workshop is to discuss in depth about LTSpice Tool and cater to the needs of students, faculty members and practicing engineers",

        "Name": "Fun-based learning: “Tower of Hanoi”",
        "Date": "6 August 2024",
        "Description": "Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: Only one disk can be moved at a time. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. Fun based learning gaming competition for this puzzle was organized for 3rd semester CSE students. The focus of the game was to motivate the students to understand the importance of algorithms analysis in development of any application.",
